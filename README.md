# About-Me
#🌀 trexii

Hey, I'm **trexii** — a kid building weird, fun, and sometimes real tools.  
I make spoof GUIs, fake hacks, and the occasional actual app, mostly for Windows.

### 🛠 What I Make
- 🎮 Fake Roblox cheat UIs (mostly harmless)
- 💻 Real C++ Win32 GUI apps
- 🔧 Experimental tools, sometimes legit
- 🧪 Just exploring how stuff works

> Use responsibly. I'm just experimenting!
